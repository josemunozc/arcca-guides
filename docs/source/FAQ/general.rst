I’ve accidentally deleted a file. Can it be restored?
-----------------------------------------------------
Unfortunately there are no backups provided for files deleted from your ``/home``
or ``/scratch`` directories and thus cannot be recovered. We advice users to keep a
copy of any critical files in an external system like the Research Data Store or a
personal external hard drive.

What software is available for profiling applications?
------------------------------------------------------
Two standard linux profilers are available, `gprof`_ and `valgrind`_.
A range of profiler tools are available on Hawk, please run “module avail” on the
cluster for more information.

How do I acknowledge ARCCA in journal publications and conference presentations?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes. Supercomputing Wales (SCW) users must acknowledge the use of the system in any
publication that contains results obtained using its resources. The SCW facilities
aim to maintain a bibliographic database of all publications that have benefited from
use of its resources. Users must notify the SCW team of all appropriate publications,
by `emailing SCW`_ the full bibliographic references.

The standard acknowledgement is:

    *This research was undertaken using the supercomputing facilities at Cardiff 
    University operated by Advanced Research Computing at Cardiff (ARCCA) on behalf
    of the Cardiff Supercomputing Facility and the Supercomputing Wales (SCW)
    project. We acknowledge the support of the latter, which is part-funded by the
    European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) via the Welsh Government*

This can be adapted particularly if a specific member of ARCCA staff has supported
you in enabling this work to include them by name in this acknowledgement.
